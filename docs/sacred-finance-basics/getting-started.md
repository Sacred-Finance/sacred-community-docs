Sacred believes in challenging Surveillance Capitalism, and privacy is the great equalizer. By working closely with the Community and the Web3 Ecosystem the project strives to create products that are intuitive, easy to use, rewarding, and, most of all, respect their privacy & allow them to maintain control over it.

Sacred is building a DeFi Protocol that strengthens the entire DeFi experience in the security of privacy, by simultaneously integrating other DeFi Protocols under a unified privacy portal (platform) and allowing other projects to use our privacy tools as well.
